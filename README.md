# Polarization of FACS Macrophages

## Evaluation of macrophage polarization in FACS macrophages

**Aim:** Validate the M1/M2 ratio in FACS macrophages.  

**Study design:**   
*Experimental groups:* I) SCI, II) SCI+medium, III) SCI+syngeneic MSCs, IV) SCI+allogenic MSCs.  

*Time points:* Transplantation (if applicable) 24 h post SCI. Sacrifice and evaluation at 3, 10 and 20 days post SCI.  

*Markers:* M1: CD16, CD32, M2: Arg1, CD206.  

**Statistical analysis**
* *Assumptions:* Normality was evaluated using Shapiro Wilk's test. Homogenity of variances was evaluated using Fligner Killeen's test.   

* *Multiple group comparison:* One way ANOVA was used given that data was normally distributed and variances were equal. Given that data was or was not normally distributed but variances were not equal Kruskal Wallis H test was used instead.   

* *Post hoc testing:* One-way ANOVA was evaluated post hoc using Tukey's post hoc test. Kruskal Wallis H test was evaluated post hoc using pair-wise Mann Whitney U tests with holm bonferroni correction.
